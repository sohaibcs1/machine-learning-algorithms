0,Priya Soni,28-Nov-20,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Worst experience and worst app to buy products because they don't provide services for the return of the product. I had put return request for my purchase on 9 Nov. 2020 and till now do one came for the pickup and when I called at the customer care they don't give reply they request me to put my call on hold for resolving the issue and after that they cut the call.

2,Upasana Choudhry,26-Nov-20,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Have major bugs. Placed an order, made UPI payment and when returned to the app it shows order cancelled message. So while on one hand payment was debited, it was not recognised by the app. Worse is there is no support available for these issues. It only has chat option but no time mentioned. One gets the impression it's 24x7 so you keep wasting time trying and don't get any response. Nit even a chat bot to inform that it is outside serviceable hours.
